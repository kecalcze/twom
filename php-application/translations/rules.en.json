In turn, the rules from the scripts may modify all of the above.<br />When several rules indicate that you should perform an action at the same time (e.g., at the start of phase X), then you need to decide the sequence of these actions.<br />This War of Mine: The Board Game is a large, complex, and elaborate game. There will surely be situations you encounter that are not covered by the rules, at these situations will raise doubts unresolved even by the FAQ scripts. In these situations, you need to use common sense and choose an interpretation that best reflects what would have happened in the real world.<br />Many of the rules are hidden and you will find them only during gameplay. Some of the rules may seem irrelevant at first, and you will come to appreciate their effective use during the Campaign as you gain more experience. The gradual discovery of the strategies and hidden internal works of the game is also part of the This War of Mine: The Board Game gameplay.<p><br /><br />HOW TO USE THE BOOK OF SCRIPTS</p><br />Do not read any of the numbered scripts in this book before encountering an entry on one of the cards, the board, a token or in another script will not indicate that particular script number. Only then you are to find that script number and resolve it.<br />Never read the whole scripts aloud – doing this will surely bore other players and ruin the thrill of the game.<br />When resolving the script, read it yourself and then, as best you can, narrate what happened in your own words. You can narrate parts of the script each time or read and then narrate the whole event at once.<br />You can read aloud any quoted letters or notes (written in italics).<br />Of course, in situations in which you absolutely cannot narrate the events from the script, as a last resort you can read the whole script aloud. Keep in mind, however, that the gameplay will suffer when you do that.<br />The fusion of the rules and the narration in the scripts is intended. The person who partakes in this experience should never hastily omit the narration in order to easily navigate through the rules. We know that for some people the only <em>“important parts”</em> are those that influence the mechanics – the rules. But it is not the case in this game.<br />Whenever you encounter a script with choices or a continuation (to another script), after the given single script is resolved, the Journal (and the role of the Leader with it) is transferred to the next player.<br /><br />BLANK TOKENS AND A, B, C... TOKENS<br />Many of the scripts instruct to write down a text entry and a script number on a Blank token.<br />When that occurs, take one of the Blank tokens that come with the game and write down on the token (with a pen, for example) the words that are required.<br />If the rules require you to remove a Blank token, you can destroy it completely, as the Blank token on which you’ve written the message will not be useful in any future game.<br />Should you run out of Blank tokes, you may use the blue A, B, C… (and so on) tokens. In such case, mark down the appropriate letter in the Notes field of the SAVE Sheet and place the words required on that sheet, while using the same letter token instead of a Blank one.<p><br /><br />CONVERSATIONS DURING GAMEPLAY</p><br />This War of Mine: The Board Game is a fully cooperative game, based first on the story being told and choices being made. The most important part of the gameplay is player communication: talking over plans and ideas together, roleplaying, enriching the narration, reflecting the Characters’ situations, both rules- and story-wise.<br />The survival of your Characters is just as important as the history you will tell and how you will remember it. What goes on over the board, between the players, is just as important as what happens on the board. As such, TWOM:TBG gameplay is very much like roleplaying games.<br />As players, you can add a significant amount of mood to the game yourselves, by enriching the scenes, describing your emotions, and playing the roles of civilians trapped in a war-torn city.<br />Try to interpret even the abstract effects of the rules, as relevant as they are to the ongoing story and the Characters participating in it. You are free to communicate during gameplay. The very light multiplayer rules were designed with the specific intent that the gameplay be fueled by player conversations and interaction.<p><br /><br />6 PLAYERS</p><br />Before you attempt a 6-player gameplay, it is recommended that most of the players know the game very well. With 6 novice players, the gameplay may be bogged down by too much downtime.<p><br /><br />THE GAMEPLAY SUPPORT APP</p><br />If you wish, you may download an additional app prepared for the game from official web pages of the publishers and from:<br />www.thiswarofminetheboardgame.com<br />It contains a handy digital copy of The Book of Scripts and a SAVE Sheet, as well as many other gadgets such as a mini-game, a time counter, and a noise detector. The full description of the app and its features can be found in its menu.<br />The FAQ scripts in the app’s The Book of Scripts will be updated online.<p><br /><br />GAME COMPONENTS</p><br />The full list of the game components can be found at the end of this book.<p><br /><br />You can download additional Save Sheets from:</p><br />www.thiswarofminetheboardgame.com<br />",

The Waste bag is used to store all the elements that were removed from the game and will not be a part of any further Campaign playthroughs. The Save bag is used to store certain elements, as described in the Saving the Game section below.<p><br /><br />SAVING THE GAME:</p><br />Throw all the tokens / resources from the Storage into the SAVE bag.<br />On the SAVE Sheet, write down the amount and type of resources that you have in the Storage x5 and throw these resources into the box.<br />In the Characters’ chart on the SAVE Sheet write down the names of the Characters and the levels of their States. Then put the State tokens into the box and the Character cards into the SAVE bag.<br />On the SAVE Sheet (on all 3 Location spaces) write down the names of the 3 Location cards you currently have on the board and throw these cards into the SAVE bag.<br />On the corresponding Shelter spaces on the SAVE Sheet mark the Shelter spaces with Shelter cards still on them (with an [X] symbol). If there were any Rubble Remnants cards on the board, change the symbol to [RR]. Then, put all Shelter cards into the SAVE bag (it does not matter if the cards mix).<br />Write down the names of the already crafted Fitting cards on the corresponding Shelter spaces on the SAVE Sheet and put these cards into the SAVE bag.<br />Put all the Cold tokens from the Cold space to the Save bag.<br />In the appropriate place on the SAVE Sheet, write down the names of the face up Event cards present on the board (if any) and put these cards into the Save bag.<br />Put the whole Events deck into the box (remember not to peek at the card’s fronts!).<br />Put all the Objective cards into the box (do not change their order).<br />Put the Night Raids deck into the SAVE bag and the unused Night Raid cards (the ones that did not make it into the deck during initial setup) into the box.<br />Put the Fittings deck into the SAVE bag (the cards from the Fittings space on the board, remember not to mix them with the Fitting cards from the Ideas space!).<br />Put the Narrative Action cards you have into the SAVE bag.<br />Mark the WAIT tokens present on the board on the SAVE Sheet by writing a [W] symbol in the corresponding places<br />Mark Board-Up tokens with an [X] symbol on the corresponding Holes on the SAVE Sheet and put these tokens into the SAVE bag.<br />Mark the position of the used Blank tokens (if there are any in the game) by writing down their numbers. Then put these tokens into the SAVE bag.<br />Put all the remaining game components into the box.<br />When you begin another Campaign playthrough, while restoring a saved game, modify the Setup rules as described in the Restoring the Game section below.<p><br /><br />RESTORING THE GAME:</p><br />Take out all the game components from the SAVE bag and place them as follows:<br />Put tokens / resources into the Storage.<br />Put the resources into the Storage x5, according to what is written on the SAVE Sheet.<br />Place the Characters and their State tokens according to what is written on the SAVE Sheet.<br />Place the 3 Location cards in the Location spaces on the board, according to what is written on the SAVE Sheet.<br />Place the Shelter cards on the board on the corresponding spaces – according to what is marked on the SAVE Sheet (pay attention to the names visible on the Shelter spaces on the board). In the place you marked [RL], flip the Rubble card so it is showing the Rubble Remnants side.<br />Place the Fitting cards on the board on the appropriate Shelter spaces – according to what is marked on the SAVE Sheet.<br />Place the rest of the Fitting cards on the Fittings deck space.<br />Place the Cold tokens on the Cold space.<br />Place the face up Event cards on their corresponding spaces according to what is marked on the SAVE Sheet (if there were any in the previous game).<br />Place the Night Raids deck on its space.<br />Take the Narrative Action cards you have.<br />Place the WAIT and Board-Up tokens on the board (if there were any in the previous game) according to what is marked on the SAVE Sheet.<br />Place the used Blank tokens on the board according to what is marked on the Save sheet.<br />Now take the rest of the elements out of the box.<br />Take the Events deck and place it on the Events space (remembering not to peek at the card’s front).<br />Take the Objectives deck and place it on the Objectives space (remembering not to mix them up and change their order).<br />Set up the rest of the decks from the box on their corresponding spaces on the board.<br />The game is now restored and you can begin another Campaign playthrough.<br />> [to=BTG].<br />",

    "100":  "100<p>SETUP FAQ</p><p><br /><br />CARD DECKS:</p><br />@ The Fittings deck, as well as the Shelter deck, other than the rest of the decks, do not have the name of the deck on the cards’ back. Take a good look at the Setup diagram to see which decks are those.<br />@ There is an instruction on how to craft them on the back of the Fitting cards, and on the front the image of the given Fitting, alongside a description of the action or rule of the Fitting.<br />@ On the back of the Shelter cards is the loot you will find during the game once you remove that card. During Setup place these cards on the board so that you cannot see what is on their backs.<p><br /><br />TOKENS AND RESOURCES:</p><br />@ All the tokens are labeled, which makes finding the proper ones easier. The three resource types (Water, Wood, Components) are not labeled, as those are not tokens but plastic pieces. You can identify them by how they look - Water is a round transparent piece, Wood is a brown cuboid and the Component is a metallic cog.<br />Red tokens are: Assault Rifle, Shotgun, Pistol, Hatchet, Knife, Broken Assault Rifle, Broken Pistol, Broken Shotgun, Weapon Part, Shell, Ammo.<br />Green tokens are: Canned Food, Raw Food, Vegetable, 100% Alcohol, Moonshine, Cigarette, Coffee, Sugar.<br />Grey tokens are: Sawblade, Shovel, Lockpick, Guitar, Broken Guitar, Book, Electrical Part, Mechanical Part, Jewelry, Filter.<br />Yellow tokens are: Meds, Bandages, Herbal Meds, Chems, Herb.<br />@ You can place the game pieces in the box in any way that is convenient to you. Try to keep the red, yellow, grey and green tokens in four separate compartments – during the game, as well as when packing them into the box. When you are packing the game back up, secure these compartments with the four card decks. The cards as well as the game board will ensure the compartments remain closed and the tokens in them will not fall out and mix with each other.<p><br /><br />WASTE BAG:</p><br />The Waste bag is used to hold those pieces which have been completely removed from gameplay and will not be available until the end of the Campaign. This is opposite to the pieces discarded into the box, which may return into gameplay during the Campaign. The Waste bag, just like the Save bag, are any bags (e.g. string bags) - 2 bags intended for such use were included with the game. Those might get worn out with frequent use, but they can be exchanged for new ones, once the original ones are not usable anymore.<p><br /><br />COLORED BASE DISCS:</p><br />@ When a Character dies, you need to detach the colored base disc from the Character’s miniature.<br />> [to=BTG].<br />",

    "110":  "110<p> BOARD FAQ</p><p><br /><br />THE STORAGE X5 SPACE:</p><br />@ The Storage x5 space allows to mark 5 Wood or Components with a single Wood or Components marker.<br />At any given time, you may exchange 5 Wood in the Storage for 1 Wood in the Storage x5, and vice versa. The same goes for the Components.<br />No other resource or token aside from Wood and Components can be placed in the Storage x5.<br />Warning: This storage system may result in creating more Wood or Components in the game at the same time than it would be possible without the Storage x5. This system can have its own drawbacks though. The rule saying that you cannot find any more resources if there are not any left in the box still stands. Which means that if we wish to exchange 1 resource out of the Storage x5 space to 5 separate resources, and there are only 3 such resources left in the box, this exchange will not be profitable.<p><br /><br />WHERE CAN WE PLACE FITTINGS:</p><br />@ Along the lines of the Journal description (the Day Actions phase), the Fittings may also be placed on the spaces with ladders. If you have any doubt whether you can place a Fitting on the given space, take a look at the SAVE Sheet - the spaces on which you cannot place Fittings are darkened.<p><br /><br />MOVING AROUND THE SHELTER:</p><br />@ If you are uncertain where the Character movement paths are on the board, look at the SAVE Sheet as well. These paths have been marked with thick dark lines.<br />@ The Hole icon blocks horizontal movement, even if it is already covered by a Board-Up token.<br />@ To know more details about moving on the board – see [to=300] (Day Actions FAQ).<p><br /><br />ADVANCED SIDE OF THE BOARD:</p><br />@ The advanced side of the board has no Ideas space. Shuffle all the Fitting cards (basic and advanced) together and place that combined deck on the Fittings space.<br />@ The Sniper Fire rule on the advanced side of the board always refers to only the Character, who has just performed an action on the top floor of the Shelter.<br />@ The rules on the board spaces, covered by the Shelter cards placed on those spaces (e.g. Wild Garden), are ignored until the given space is cleared.<br />@ „2x RUBBLE CARDS”</em> means that during Setup you need to place 2 Rubble cards, in a stack, and that they need to be resolved one after the other.<br />> [to=BTG].<br />",

Such knowledge will also enable you to use the benefits of some of the Event cards. To accurately foresee the upcoming Events you should craft a Radio (a Fitting card) and use the Tune In action on the Radio card.<p><br /><br />CHAPTER AND OBJECTIVE CARDs:</p><br />@ The Objectives cards are on the Objectives space in a stack. The Final Objective card is at the very bottom of the stack. The top Objective card is assigned to Chapter I, the middle one to Chapter II and the bottom one (Final Objective) to Chapter III.<br />Only the current top Objective card is available, you cannot start completing a later Objective without completing the current one first.<br />Rewards and Penalties from an Objective card can be resolved only when the Chapter card is being resolved, even if the Objective described on it has been completed before.<br />@ In case of Objective cards with a counter on them, when the card is being placed on the top of the Objectives stack, the Objective Status token should be placed on the leftmost space on the counter.<br />@ You can at any time discard 1 or more required tokens / resources from the Storage (not from the Findings Pile!), by accordingly moving the Objective Status token right.<br />The tokens being discarded this way cannot be used or sold at the same time.<br />@ Once the Objective Status token reaches the rightmost space on the counter, marked with a green <em>“V”</em>, the Objective is completed (although it may be resolved only when the Chapter card is being resolved).<br />@ Warning: Should the group during a Campaign lose the last of the starting Characters, which means they are unable to complete the Final Objective, the players may forfeit the further game, but they are not required to. It all depends on whether they decide that only a complete victory matters or that they wish to just allow the remaining Characters to reach the end of the story, regardless whether this means they win or lose the game itself.<br />> [to=BTG].<br />",
    "220":  "220<p> STATE TOKENS FAQ</p><br />@ It bears indicating that the black dots on State tokens do not stack. This means that each State token indicates WHICH actions are unavailable.<br />If, for example, 2 different State tokens say that the given Character cannot use their third action, then despite that there are 2 such State tokens, the Character is disallowed only that third action.<br />@ If a rule tells you to raise the State X by 1, this means that the Character with the State X of 0 receives a State X level 1 token.<br />@ If the given Character’s Fatigue level reaches 4 due to them being assigned to tasks (e.g. Guard Duty, Scavenging), the Character will be able to normally finish their task and only after it is done, the Fatigue level of 4 should be resolved.<br />@ If a Character reaches level 4 on two States simultaneously (excluding the Fatigue), and both direct you to two different scripts containing epilogues for this Character, you need to randomly select either of them to be resolved.<br />@ If a given State is raised to level 4, it is already too late to lower it again to level 3, before resolving the results of level 4. The State level 4 effect needs to be resolved immediately.<br />@ The State level 4 tokens show different script numbers, leading to different epilogues.

    "300":  "300<p> DAY ACTIONS PHASE FAQ</p><p><br /><br />MOVEMENT IN THE SHELTER:</p><br />@ Movement in the Shelter is a bit abstract - you need to imagine the miniatures move around freely on the floors and use the ladders to move between each floor. Such movement is free and instantaneous.<br />@ If you are uncertain where the Character movement paths are on the board, look at the SAVE Sheet. These paths have been marked with thick dark lines.<br />@ If a Shelter card is blocking passage (e.g. Closed Door, Bars, Rubble), it means that the furthest a Character can move along this path is up to that very card (to perform an action there and remove the obstacle).<br />@ The Hole icon blocks horizontal movement, even if it is already covered by a Board-Up token.<p><br /><br />CRAFTING FITTINGS:</p><br />@ There are so many Fitting cards that it is a good idea to stop the game at some point and browse them all, while discussing together which ones will be most useful in the current situation and checking which tokens or resources will be required to craft these Fittings.<br />@ As described in the Journal (the Day Actions phase), the Fittings may also be crafted on the spaces with ladders. If you have any doubt whether you can craft a Fitting on the given space, take a look at the SAVE Sheet - the spaces on which you cannot craft Fittings are darkened.<br />@ The Fitting cards in the Ideas deck are not available for crafting in the regular way. You cannot craft them by taking them directly from the Ideas deck. First, you need to use the New Idea board action, which enables you to choose any 2 cards from the Ideas deck and add them into the Fittings deck. From that point on, those two cards can be crafted as normal.<br />@ The <em>“place directly next to […]”</em> rule you can see on the back of many Fitting cards (that are an upgrade to other Fittings), means that such a card can be crafted ONLY on the space horizontally adjacent to the required card.<br />If there is not any free space to place such a card, it cannot be crafted. That is why, in case of building cards which are upgradeable by placing other cards alongside them, it is important to plan ahead from the start.<br />The upgradeable Fitting cards and the upgrade cards themselves are additionally marked with two diagonal lines.<p><br /><br />ACTIONS:</p><br />@ The tokens and resources required to perform actions are immediately discarded as soon as a Character is assigned to perform the action.<br />@ The tokens and resources created by an action are added to the Storage only after the action has been resolved.<br />@ The <em>“For each X -> Y”</em> rule in the description on many of the Fitting cards means that this action allows you to discard any number of <em>“X”</em> and in doing that create the equivalent number of <em>“Y”</em> in the course of the same action.<br />@ In each of the three stages of the Day Actions phase all effects of the actions to which Characters have been assigned are resolved simultaneously. This means that the tokens and resources gained in these actions cannot be immediately used to another action during the same stage.<br />@ A Character who has just joined the group cannot use their action during the stage in which they joined. They can use actions from the next stage onwards, as long as their States permit them to.<br />@ Characters who cannot perform any actions in a given stage of the Day Actions phase (due to black dots on the State token) may be moved to the Storage, making the situation on the board clearer.<p><br /><br />SHELTER CARDS ACTIONS:</p><br />@ To use an action on a Heap or Furniture card you only need to assign 1 Character to that card. In effect, the back of the card is resolved, adding appropriate tokens and resources to the Storage.<br />@ To use an action on a Rubble card, you need to assign to it either 1 Character and a Shovel token from the Storage, or 2 Characters. In effect, this card is flipped to its back - the rubble has been partially, but not fully removed.<br />@ To use an action on a Rubble Remnants card, you need to act just like above in case of the Rubble card. In effect, the card is removed from the game, which means the space is fully cleared. This gives you an additional space to place Fittings on, as well as access to spaces previously blocked by the Rubble.<br />@ To use an action on a Bars card, you need to assign to it 1 Character and a Sawblade token from the Storage. In effect, the back of the card is resolved - appropriate tokens and resources are added to the Storage and this card is removed. This clears the space, just like with the Rubble card.<br />@ To use an action on a Closed Door card, you need to assign to it 1 Character and a Lockpick token from the Storage. In effect, an attempt to open the Closed Door is made and the Black die is rolled.<br />In case of failure, nothing happens. You have only wasted an action.<br />If you succeed, you discard the Lockpick token and get to resolve the back of the card. This means appropriate tokens and resources are added to the Storage and the card is removed from the game.

The first role, when the front of each card is being resolved, is describing what happens when Characters are exploring. The other, when you return them to the Exploration deck without checking their fronts, is the time and effort that the players made. The more cards they sacrifice to act more cautiously, the less thoroughly their Characters will search the Location (and the fewer Exploration cards’ fronts will be resolved).<br />@ The placement of the words <em>“OR”</em> and <em>“TO”</em>, as well as the empty lines of text, is intentional. It indicates the point of alternative or implication. For example:<br />I) You may ignore this card<p><br />OR</p><br />IIa) Search the FURNITURE:<br />IIa1) Return 2 Exploration cards<p><br />OR</p><br />IIa2) Raise the Noise by 1 and roll for the Noise<p><br />TO</p><br />IIb) Draw and resolve 1 card from the Findings deck (Furniture chart).<br />@ When the cards from the Exploration deck are depleted, simply shuffle the Discard pile and create a new Exploration deck out of these cards. Warning – This rule goes for the Exploration deck, but not the Unknown deck.<p><br /><br />FINDINGS CARDS:</p><br />@ If an encounter with a Resident happens while resolving a Findings card, you should first resolve the Residents card, and then come back to resolving the Findings card.<br />@ If taking Findings can result in consequences (e.g. the effects of the Residents cards: Civilians, Hobos or Survivors), you may first check what exactly was found and then decide whether to still take it regardless of the consequences or change your mind and leave it alone.<p><br /><br />MAP CARDS:</p><br />@ In the beginning of the Choose Findings stage the Journal tells you to shuffle all Exploration and Residents cards into their decks. This goes also for the Map cards in the Exploration slot. During a later visit in the same Location all the Map cards are shuffled back into the Exploration deck – even if you, for example, opened a Closed Door during your last visit, you may again encounter a Closed Door and open them again.<p><br /><br />NOISE:</p><br />@ The Noise cannot at any time be raised above 8 or lowered below 1.<br />@ If a rule allows you to ignore a drawn Residents card, the Noise is still reduced to 1 due to the encounter being triggered.<p><br /><br />DEATH OF ALL CHARACTERS:</p><br />> When all of the Characters taking part in Scavenging are dead, see [to=266].<p><br /><br />FINDINGS PILE:</p><br />@ The Findings Pile represents carrying around all the tokens the Characters find while Scavenging. Only when they are gearing up to return home (during the Choose Findings stage), your Characters estimate their strength (the Inventory total of the Characters participating in Scavenging) and choose what they wish to take home to the Shelter and what will be abandoned as it is too heavy to take all the way through the city.<p><br /><br />CHOOSE FINDINGS STAGE:</p><br />@ The Choose Findings stage rules state that a player can add as many resources (Water, Wood, Components) as he wants to the Findings Pile. The only limits are the weight and the Inventories of the Characters participating in the Scavenging.<br /><strong>> Advanced rules –</strong> see [to=534].<br />> Or [to=BTG].<br />",

This means they cannot do this if their Fatigue value is already 3 or 4.<br />@ EXCHANGING LOCATIONS – at the beginning or the end of the Scavenging you may return 4 Exploration cards to exchange any of the 3 Locations placed on the board and draw a new one from the Locations deck.<br />> [to=BTG].<br />",

They must have both been hit by a sniper from the nearby hill.

We can hear the hum of a generator, and there’s a blinking light bulb, a sign of electricity. A tall, broad-shouldered man is walking around the room, dressed in a white, but fairly dirty, doctor’s coat. He’s preparing some tools.<br />In the corner there is a… wait a moment, is that a gynecological chair? Someone knocks at the door. Two women enter, one older and one younger, probably a mother and daughter. They talk to the doctor for a while, and then the younger woman sits in the chair. The doctor puts on gloves, and the procedure begins.<br />We can’t see exactly what is going on, but at one point all we can hear is a scream and weeping, then the rattle of tools being placed on a metal table next to the chair.<br />The younger woman leaves the chair weeping.

She pushed her daughter toward him.<br /><em>“Gentlemen, dinner is served!”</em> – the man hollered to his comrades, and shut the door.<br /><em>“I’ll come pick her up in an hour!”</em> – the mother reminded the man.

At the start of the conflict he tried to calm people in his speeches and interviews, telling everyone to stay in their homes and patiently wait for the results of the negotiations. He always stressed the <em>“necessity to solve racial and national issues at any cost.”</em> He was always supporting decisive solutions.

The rest of the women from the bus, glued to the windows like perched birds, watch every horrible detail. Their tears and laments echo across the surrounding buildings.
